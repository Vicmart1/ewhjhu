Victor:

The web space has been created and will be live later today.

Instructions for accessing the file system and other important information are at http://it.johnshopkins.edu/services/webservices/webdav.  Once you have followed the instructions for your particular OS, you will have a network share you use just like any other disk attached to your computer. Files must go in the public_html/ directory.  We run SELInux and for this reason the public_html/ directory itself must never be deleted (you can delete anything within it as needed).

If you use Microsoft Windows and have slow performance with a mapped network share/drive, go to Control Panel -> Internet Options and click the "Connections" tab.  On that page, click the "LAN Settings" button.  On that LAN Settings page, uncheck "Automatically detect settings" and click OK to back out of the various screens.  

If that does not improve performance or you use Mac OS X and have slow connections, you can download a program called cyberduck from http://cyberduck.ch.  It may have a silly name, but it is a rock-solid program that has been around for several years.  You can see a sample screenshot for the setup at http://pages.jh.edu/~websvcs/cyberduck-setup.png

You MUST keep a backup of your files should you need to restore any due to accidental change or deletion.
